	Our designer pal Alex came to us (developers) with an interesting remark. He said: It could rock if we could use Android Palette in our web, but we can't! could we? can you do it?

	Challange accepted! 

	Like usual we discussed options during breakfast, we drew it as a decoupled service that could run in its own server.
	So we have these fun lab days at work, a Friday every three weeks and we decided to give it shot. 

	So ... what is Android Material Palette?
	Android Material Palette is a helper class to extract prominent colors from an image. It is part of the Android Open Source Project which means we have access to source files. Kiitos Google :)

	Setup:
	So Dani helped me out here, he mumbled some details about IaaS versus PaaS and then we went for Infrastructure as a Service.
	We installed AWS plugin for eclipse, configured, created and deployed a new Java Project as AWS Elastic Beanstalk Application.
	Within a few minutes we had an application running on a AWS Elastic Beanstalk server. 

	Development: 
	


	Sharing:
	New git repo with the sources.
