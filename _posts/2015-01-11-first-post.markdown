<p>Ok, so broad as it sounds: we talk about technology. On a normal day, during breakfast we run through frameworks, libraries, tools, APIs, apps, meetups, TEDs, hackathons, events and ... occasionally mention football.</p>

<p>Then we go back to work and live the normal developer life, which (lets admit it) is frustrating. 
There are potential fight triggers all around: a proxy change, an expired certificate, a stacks limit exceeded exception, failing acceptance tests, or an assortment of many other stupid things that might (and will) go wrong eventually.</p> 

<p>I confess I get upset when things don’t work, and unfortunately things don’t always go smoothly. Luckily we both learn along the way. For instance, I learned my boyfriend is not responsible for everything that will potentially go wrong during a User Story. He is actually pretty damn good at what he does! He, on the other hand, learned that I am very demanding and I always expect 11 out of 10, and thath makes him more demanding as well. So we both rock!</p>

<p>Which brings us back to the beginning, we talk about technology shaped into a marital argument. A developer and a DevOps engineer that must get along because they are simply made for each other.</p>

<p>Enjoy our technological “fights”!!</p>
