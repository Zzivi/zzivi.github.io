I also have a past: I gave technical assistance (and sometimes moral support) to Web Services clients. 
During this time I learned two very valuable lessons:
<ol>
<li>A contract is more serious than a marriage</li>
<li>Legacy services are like Chuck Norris, chances are they simply won't die</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
So I learned to develop, use, troubleshoot and live with these services.
</p>
<p>
By that time WS were far from trendy and not cool enough to be regarded as "vintage". 
Back then the world (read: google, fb, twitter) was taking about REST APIs and of course we dived in.
I learned that with REST APIs it is all about the model and if is consistent your life is much easier.
</p>
<p>
Now I am an Android developer so I am both provider and consumer of these services.
<ol>
<li>A contract is still more serious than a marriage</li>
<li>It is more hurtful breaking your own client</li>
<li>Entity: To be or not be, with REST this truly is the question.</li>
</p>
<p>
<b>Microservices</b> bells are ringing and I can only assume it will get messy before it gets fancy ;D. 
<b>No pain, no gain</b>.
